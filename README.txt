Provides \Figure[<key=value pairs>]{<image filename>} to easily include
an image as figure in the most common form (centered and with caption and label).
Caption and label can be set using the 'caption' and 'label' key. The label defaults
to 'fig:<image filename>' if not used.

The package uses the authors other package 'adjustbox' to center and image and to
allow for easy further modifications.

As 'adjustbox' now provides keys to turn images or other material into floats or 
non-floats including captions this package has become quite redundant.
